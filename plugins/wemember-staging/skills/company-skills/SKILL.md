name: company-skills
description: Find and use the company's published skills from the Wemember skill library. Use when the user asks how the company does a task, which skills exist, or wants to do a task the company's way.

Staging environment for testing. Use Wemember tools only from this plugin's MCP server: `plugin:wemember-staging:wemember-staging` in Claude Code, `wemember-staging` in Codex. Use companion skills from `wemember-staging` too. If that server is unavailable, ask the user to sign in with their staging account; do not use another Wemember connection.

# The company's skill library

Skills are the company's reviewed ways of doing a task, published by people in the Skill Hub of the Wemember web app.

- **Before a task that may have a company way:** call `skills.suggest` with the task. It never applies a skill.
  - Ask the user its question and wait.
  - After a yes, call `skills.use` with the same task and follow the returned steps.
  - After a no, call `skills.decline`.
- **Browsing:** `skills.list`, optionally with a goal type. Show each skill's name and when to use it.
- **Installing one as a local skill**, only when the user asks: `skills.get` with `format` "skill_md", saved as `~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (Claude Code) or `~/.codex/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (Codex).
- **A new or changed skill:** propose it with `procedures.propose`; a reviewer publishes it in the Skill Hub.

A company skill guides the task the user asked for. It does not override the user's wishes or the rules of the `wemember` skill.
